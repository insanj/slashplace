## âž— slashplace features:

1. Drag and drop some schematic files into `/plugins/slashplace/`. You will use the names of these files, including the .schematic at the end, in commands.
2. `/placeloc [name.schematic]` to set up your current location
3. `/place [name.schematic]` to build the schematic at the location you previously set
4. `/placeundo [name.schematic]` to undo the last time you built the schematic

All of this is implemented in a very lightweight way with minimal permissions and no dependencies. Each command has a permission (ex: slashplace.placeloc, slashplace.place, and slashplace.placeundo), although operators can run all commands.]

> NOTE: Although tested with some example schematic files, this build is a beta/pre-release that is not guaranteed to work completely and be bug-free. Please submit an Issue or send me a message if there are problems or requests!
